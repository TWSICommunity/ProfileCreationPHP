# ProfileCreationPHP
A PHP profile script built by me and relies on PHP and not MySQL.

How to install?

No configuration is required. Just upload the zip file into your web hosting site. Execpt for the users/admin/admin.php.

How to setup the admin configs.
1. Goto users/admin/admin.php
2. Edit these lines.
$username = "admin";
$password = "password";
to
$username = "theusernamehere";
$password = "whateverpasswordyouuse";
And done, just save it and use it to suspend, backup and unsuspend a page what ever you feel like it.
